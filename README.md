## Quick Start

```bash
# Install as Claude Code skill
git clone https://github.com/JoaquinMulet/Artificial-General-Research.git
cp -r Artificial-General-Research/skills/agr ~/.claude/skills/

# Setup wizard (inside Claude Code)
/agr speed                    # optimize for speed
/agr accuracy                 # optimize for accuracy
/agr "bundle size"            # optimize for bundle size

# Launch the autonomous loop
bash run_agr.sh --max 10      # 10 experiments to start
```

That's it. AGR generates all needed files (`benchmark.py`, `STRATEGY.md`, `program.md`, etc.), establishes a baseline, and starts experimenting autonomously.

## Why AGR?

AGR is a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that turns any measurable optimization problem into an autonomous research loop. It builds on [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), [Goenka's Guard/Metric separation](https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch), and [Bria's Ralph Loop](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) — and adds **9 new ideas** discovered through real-world experimentation:

| What AGR Adds | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Fresh context per iteration** | Iteration 100 reasons as well as iteration 1 — no context degradation |
| **Per-benchmark variance analysis** | Noisy benchmarks don't mask real improvements in other components |
| **Measurement artifact detection** | Catches when "improvements" are actually baseline outliers |
| **Metric + Guard + Rework** | Good ideas with implementation bugs get fixed, not thrown away |
| **STRATEGY.md persistent brain** | The agent remembers WHY things failed, not just that they did |
| **Exhausted Approaches registry** | Entire failed categories get blocked — no more retrying compiler flags 4 times |
| **Stuck detection protocol** | After 5 discards: try opposites, combine successes, go radical |
| **Complexity budget** | Large changes get split into keep/discard-able steps across iterations |
| **Supervisor pattern** | Human or parent agent audits discards for hidden per-benchmark wins |

---

## Works For Any Measurable Problem

| Use Case | Metric | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| **Library speed** | Wall-clock time | Checksums match |
| **Bundle size** | KB after build | Tests pass |
| **ML accuracy** | F1 score | Min threshold met |
| **API latency** | p95 response time | Integration tests pass |
| **Lighthouse score** | Performance score | No visual regression |
| **SQL optimization** | Query execution time | Same result set |
| **Prompt engineering** | Eval score | Golden set matches |
| **Cloud costs** | $/month | Functionality tests pass |
| **Docker image size** | MB after build | Container health check passes |
| **Code coverage** | % coverage | No test regressions |

### Timeline

![AGR Optimization Timeline](progress.png)

*Green circles = real improvements. Orange diamonds = phantom improvements (header changes that weren't compiled due to a build system bug the agent discovered). Red arrow = the moment the agent discovered the bug and activated all accumulated optimizations.*

### Every Optimization Found (in order)

| # | What AGR Did | Files Changed | Speedup | Type | Correctness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `std::pow(x,2)` → `x*x` and `std::pow(c,0.5)` → `sqrtf(c)` in distance() | `utils.hpp` | 18x on distance() | C++ micro | PASS |
| 2 | Pre-computed coordinate diffs in LOO2D/LOO3D constructor, reused storage across eval() calls | `adaptive_esi_idw.hpp` | Eliminated per-eval heap allocation | C++ memory | PASS |
| 3 | `std::pow(dist_sq, half_exp)` → `exp2f(half_exp * log2f(dist_sq))` | `adaptive_esi_idw.hpp` | ~10% in LOO inner loop | C++ math | PASS |
| 4 | Vectorized KDE fitting — replaced per-point sklearn KDE with batch NumPy: vectorized Silverman bandwidth, batch random index selection + kernel noise. Eliminated all sklearn and joblib overhead. | `ess/_main.py` | **53x** on ESS pipeline | Python algorithmic | PASS |
| 5 | Grid search evaluation cache — `unordered_map` keyed on integer grid indices, shared across `best_of` random restarts | `utils.hpp` | ~5% on adaptive ESI | C++ caching | PASS |
| 6 | Parallelized `estimate()` tree loop with OpenMP + passed `search_leaf` by const reference to eliminate vector copies | `abstract_esi.hpp`, `libspatialize.cpp` | **18x** uniform across all benchmarks | C++ parallelism | PASS |
| 7 | Discovered setuptools build bug: `.hpp` header changes weren't triggering recompilation. `rm -rf build/` activated ALL previous header optimizations at once. Also fixed GIL crash — `PyErr_CheckSignals()` was called inside OMP parallel region without holding the GIL. | `libspatialize.cpp`, build system | 28.73s → 1.21s in one step | Bug discovery | PASS |
| 8 | Flattened `post_process` from tree-level to leaf-level OMP parallelism with size-descending sort for better load balancing. Pre-generated random numbers outside parallel region for determinism. | `adaptive_esi_idw.hpp` | 14% on adaptive ESI | C++ parallelism | PASS |

### Per-Benchmark Results

| Benchmark | Baseline | After AGR | Speedup | What It Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adaptive ESI 2D | 33.39s | 0.42s | **80x** | Grid search + LOO cross-validation per partition leaf |
| ESI + ESS Pipeline | 14.59s | 0.27s | **53x** | Full estimation → KDE fitting → stochastic simulation |
| ESI IDW 2D | 3.34s | 0.18s | **18x** | Core Mondrian partitioning + IDW interpolation |
| ESI IDW 3D | 1.80s | 0.10s | **18x** | Higher-dimensional spatial estimation |
| Hparam Search | 0.42s | 0.15s | **3x** | K-fold cross-validation over parameter grid |

### What The Agent ALSO Tried (Discarded — But Valuable Data)

These experiments didn't improve performance but taught the agent what NOT to try:

| # | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Category Exhausted? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fuse LOO2D two-pass into single-pass | Two-pass vectorizes better on MSVC; dist_pow matrix fits in L1 cache | Yes: loop fusion |
| 2 | MSVC `/fp:fast` compiler flag | Net negative: fast-math interfered with existing optimizations | Yes: compiler flags |
| 3 | Branchless LOO IDW loop (sentinel diagonal) | Branch is well-predicted by CPU; exp2f/log2f dominates, not the IDW accumulation | Yes: LOO micro-opts |
| 4 | MSVC `/arch:AVX2` flag | AVX frequency throttling; scalar CRT functions can't auto-vectorize | Yes: compiler flags |
| 5 | Leaf-level parallelism in post_process (first attempt) | System was under load (all benchmarks uniformly 20% slower) — measurement artifact | No: retried later successfully |
| 6 | Remove inner OpenMP from LOO2D/LOO3D::eval() | OMP overhead for nested regions is negligible | Yes: nested OMP |
| 7 | Optimize grid_search hot loop (const ref, pre-alloc) | Grid search converges in ~5-10 steps for small leaves — overhead is minimal | Yes: grid_search micro-opts |
| 8 | Parallelize k_fold/LOO tree loops with OMP | OMP overhead exceeds work for small items | Yes: small-work OMP |
| 9 | Retry remove inner OMP (clean build) | Confirmed: no improvement even with clean build | Confirmed |

### What AGR Demonstrated In Practice

**1. The agent naturally escalates complexity.** It started with easy wins (`pow→x*x`), moved to memory optimizations (pre-compute diffs), then algorithmic changes (vectorize KDE), then parallelism (OMP tree loops), and finally architectural changes (flatten post_process to leaf-level OMP). No human guided this progression — the STRATEGY.md bottleneck analysis drove it.

**2. Exhausted Approaches prevent wasted iterations.** After 4 failed compiler flag experiments, the agent marked "compiler flags" as exhausted and stopped trying them. Same for "LOO micro-optimizations" after 3 failures. Without this, the agent would keep retrying variations of the same failed category.

**3. The agent found a build system bug no human noticed.** Setuptools with pybind11 doesn't track `.hpp` header dependencies — only `.cpp` source file changes trigger recompilation. The agent discovered this by running `rm -rf build/` as part of a clean rebuild, which activated ALL accumulated header optimizations at once (28.73s → 1.21s). This is arguably the most valuable finding of the entire campaign.

**4. The GIL crash fix was a critical safety improvement.** The agent found that `PyErr_CheckSignals()` (needed for Ctrl+C handling) was being called inside an OpenMP parallel region without holding the GIL, causing random segfaults. This bug existed in the original code and would have affected all users.

**5. Measurement variance is real and dangerous.** 4 experiments were incorrectly discarded because `adaptive_esi` (82% of total time) had ±1s variance that masked real 120ms improvements in `esi_idw_3d`. The supervisor audit caught this. Also, one kept baseline measurement (1.56s) was an outlier — the true value was ~1.44s. Every subsequent experiment that "improved" this benchmark was actually just returning to the real value.

**6. "Phantom improvements" from stale builds.** Because headers weren't being recompiled, the agent measured "improvements" of -16.4%, -12.7%, -2.2% that were actually measurement noise. The real improvements from those header changes only materialized after the clean rebuild. This is a cautionary tale for any autoresearch system working with compiled languages.

**7. Simplicity wins.** Several kept experiments not only made the code faster but also simpler — fewer allocations, const references instead of copies, removed dead OpenMP nesting. The simplicity criterion prevented complexity accumulation.

### Dimension of Changes for Code Review

The total code review for all optimizations is **~589 lines of diff across 11 files**. The core changes are concentrated in 3 C++ headers and 1 Python file. An experienced C++ reviewer can audit this in 2-3 hours.

```
include/spatialize/adaptive_esi_idw.hpp  — LOO2D/LOO3D pre-compute, flatten OMP
include/spatialize/abstract_esi.hpp      — Parallelize estimate(), const ref
include/spatialize/utils.hpp             — distance() sqrt, grid_search cache
src/python/spatialize/gs/ess/_main.py    — Vectorized KDE (bypass sklearn)
```

### Claude Code Flags

```bash
claude -p "$(cat program.md)" \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --max-turns 200 \
    --effort high
```

| Flag | What It Does | Why AGR Uses It |
|---|---|---|
| `-p` | Headless mode — read prompt, execute, exit | Fresh context each iteration (Ralph Loop) |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skip all permission prompts | Full autonomy: read, write, compile, benchmark without asking |
| `--max-turns 200` | Max tool calls per session | Safety limit. 50 for interpreted languages, 100-200 for compiled (C++ build takes many turns) |
| `--effort high` | Deeper reasoning | Optimization decisions need code analysis, not quick answers |
| `--max-budget-usd N` | Cost cap per iteration | Optional. Prevents runaway cost on complex iterations |
| `-w` / `--worktree` | Git worktree isolation | Advanced: run parallel experiments on separate branches |

## The 9 Technical Contributions (Deep Dive)

AGR is not a fork or a copy. It builds on Karpathy's, Goenka's, and Bria's work and introduces **9 new technical contributions** discovered through real-world experimentation:

### 1. Fresh Context Per Iteration (Ralph Loop + Externalized State)

**Problem**: Existing implementations run in one long conversation. By experiment 50+, the LLM context window is heavily compressed and the agent makes worse optimization decisions.

**Our solution**: Each iteration is a **disposable Claude Code instance** (`claude -p`). The agent reads ALL state from files, does ONE experiment, logs everything, and exits. The loop script (`run_agr.sh`) restarts it with a clean context.

**Key insight**: All state must be externalized to files — `results.tsv` (history), `STRATEGY.md` (brain), `git log` (code evolution), `baseline_checksums.json` (correctness). Nothing lives in the context window. This means iteration 100 has **identical reasoning quality** to iteration 1.

```
Iteration 1:   [fresh context] → reads files → optimizes → logs → DIES
Iteration 100: [fresh context] → reads files → optimizes → logs → DIES
                  ↑ Same quality, same speed, no degradation
```

### 2. Per-Benchmark Variance Analysis

**Problem**: We discovered that our dominant benchmark (`adaptive_esi`, 82% of total time) had **±1s measurement variance**. This noise masked a real 120ms improvement in `esi_idw_3d`. We incorrectly discarded 4 experiments that had genuine improvements.

**Our solution**: Instead of only checking `total_time < previous_best`, AGR evaluates each sub-benchmark independently:

- A benchmark "improved" only if it exceeds its measured noise band (>5% or >2 sigma)
- A benchmark "regressed" only if it worsened beyond its noise band
- KEEP if ANY benchmark genuinely improved without others genuinely regressing

**Why this matters**: Without this, a noisy dominant benchmark acts as a random gate that discards real improvements ~50% of the time. With per-benchmark analysis, signal is separated from noise.

### 3. Measurement Artifact Detection

**Problem**: After discarding 4 experiments, we noticed ALL of them showed the same "improvement" in `esi_idw_3d` (1.56s → ~1.44s). Was this real?

**Our solution**: If ALL experiments (including discards) show the same improvement in a benchmark, it's not an optimization — it's a **measurement artifact** (the baseline was an outlier). AGR detects this pattern and flags the baseline for re-measurement instead of crediting non-existent improvements.

### 4. Metric + Guard Separation with Rework Protocol

**Problem**: Traditional autoresearch treats the optimization metric and correctness as one combined check. If a change is faster but breaks tests, it's discarded entirely — losing a potentially good optimization idea.

**Our solution** (inspired by Goenka's Guard concept, extended with rework):
- **Metric**: the number being optimized (e.g., execution time)
- **Guard**: a pass/fail correctness check (e.g., checksums, tests)
- If Metric improved but Guard failed: **REWORK** — fix the implementation (not the approach), max 2 attempts
- If still failing after 2 reworks: discard

This saves good optimization ideas that simply have implementation bugs.

### 5. STRATEGY.md as Persistent Agent Brain

**Problem**: In a fresh-context-per-iteration system, the agent has no memory of WHY previous experiments succeeded or failed. It might repeat the same failed approach.

**Our solution**: `STRATEGY.md` is a structured document the agent reads first and updates last. It contains:

- **Current State**: best metric value, iteration count
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: per-benchmark breakdown with priorities
- **Ideas to Try**: prioritized list with expected impact
- **Ideas Already Tried**: what was tried, result, and **WHY** it worked or failed
- **Exhausted Approaches**: entire categories marked as "don't retry"
- **Key Insights**: accumulated knowledge about the codebase

The WHY is critical. Not just "compiler flags failed" but "compiler flags failed because `exp2f`/`log2f` are scalar CRT functions that can't auto-vectorize, and AVX2 causes frequency throttling on mixed workloads."

### 6. Exhausted Approaches Registry

**Problem**: After 4 failed compiler flag experiments (`/fp:fast`, `/arch:AVX2`, etc.), the agent kept trying new compiler flags.

**Our solution**: When a CATEGORY of approaches is depleted, it's added to "Exhausted Approaches" in STRATEGY.md with an explicit instruction not to retry:

```markdown
## Exhausted Approaches (don't retry)
- **Compiler flags**: 4 experiments failed. MSVC optimization is maxed.
- **LOO2D::eval micro-optimizations**: 3 experiments failed. Per-eval cost is near-optimal.
- **Leaf-level parallelism**: load balancing already adequate with tree-level scheduling.
```

Future iterations read this and skip entire categories, focusing on unexplored approaches.

### 7. Stuck Detection Protocol

**Problem**: After multiple consecutive discards, the agent tends to make increasingly minor variations of the same failed approach.

**Our solution**: When >5 consecutive discards are detected in `results.tsv`:

1. Re-read ALL source files (not just the hot path)
2. Review the entire results log for patterns (what categories work? what don't?)
3. Try **combining** 2-3 previous successful optimizations in a new way
4. Try the **opposite** approach of recent failures
5. Try a **radical architectural change** (different algorithm, not micro-opt)

### 8. Complexity Budget (Divide Large Changes)

**Problem**: With more turns available (100-200), the agent sometimes attempts massive refactors that span multiple files, exceed the turn limit, and produce incomplete changes.

**Our solution**: A "complexity budget" rule in `program.md`:

> If a change requires more than ~30 tool calls to implement, it's TOO BIG for one iteration. Break it into smaller steps:
> - Step 1: refactor to expose the optimization opportunity (keep if code is simpler)
> - Step 2: apply the optimization on the clean refactored code
> - Each step is a separate iteration with its own keep/discard decision

This leverages the **simplicity criterion** — a refactoring-only step that produces simpler code is kept even without performance improvement.

### 9. Supervisor Pattern with Discard Auditing

**Problem**: The autonomous agent discards experiments based on total metric. But a supervisor reviewing the data can spot improvements the agent missed.

**Our solution**: A supervisor (human or parent Claude Code session) periodically:

- Reads `results.tsv` to see all experiments including discards
- Audits discarded experiments for **hidden per-benchmark improvements**
- Checks if multiple discards share a common improvement (suggesting the baseline is the outlier)
- Adjusts `STRATEGY.md` between batches based on findings
- Views `progress.png` for visual pattern recognition

In our case study, the supervisor audit revealed that 4 discarded experiments all improved `esi_idw_3d` by ~7% — flagging a baseline measurement outlier that the autonomous agent couldn't detect on its own.
